# ProofPay — AI verified bounty escrow

ProofPay locks a demo reward on HSKChain, lets a human or an AI agent deliver work, and lets an AI verifier check the result against written acceptance criteria. A poster has 60 seconds to dispute an approval. After that, the verifier service calls the public `claim` function to release payment; anyone can call it manually if the service is offline.

**This is a hackathon prototype. `mUSDT` is an unrestricted mint demo token with no value. Do not use real funds.**

GitHub repository: [YvesZhou-hub/proofpay-hskchain](https://github.com/YvesZhou-hub/proofpay-hskchain).

Live testnet demo: [proofpay-hskchain.vercel.app](https://proofpay-hskchain.vercel.app). Task #0 is a clearly labelled scripted rehearsal; task #1 used real DeepSeek API calls for worker output and verification, then paid the worker on chain. The submission API runs on the demo Mac and reaches Vercel through a temporary HTTPS tunnel; keep the Mac, API process and tunnel online during judging.

## What works

- Create a bounty by approving and locking 6-decimal `mUSDT` in `BountyEscrow`.
- Accept and submit as a human via the web app, or let an agent wallet do both.
- Store submission text in the service; keep its URI and Keccak-256 hash on chain.
- AI verifier checks the stored text hash, returns a JSON verdict, and commits the reason hash on chain.
- Show the score and reason in the UI and verify the reason against its on-chain hash.
- Dispute during the challenge window; an arbiter decides where the escrow goes.
- Automatically call `claim` after 60 seconds while the verifier service is running; permissionless manual claim remains available.
- Refund an open or taken bounty after its deadline.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+, npm and [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- Browser wallet (MetaMask or another injected EVM wallet)
- Test HSK for the deployer, agent and verifier wallets from the [official HSKChain faucet guide](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Build-on-HashKey-Chain/Tools/Faucet)
- A DeepSeek or OpenAI API key for actual AI execution. `DEMO_MODE=1` runs a scripted dry run and labels its output as such.

HSKChain testnet: chain ID **133**, RPC `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`, live explorer `https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net`. The [official quickstart](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Developer-QuickStart) still lists `testnet-explorer.hsk.xyz`, which did not resolve on 26 September 2026; the [Chainlist entry](https://chainid.network/chain/133/) lists the working domain. RPC chain ID and the working explorer were checked live.

Verified HSKChain testnet deployment (26 September 2026):

| Contract | Address |
| --- | --- |
| BountyEscrow | [`0xE0c95F19d607bA0B3100F1c942589B63D4f3Ea03`](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/address/0xE0c95F19d607bA0B3100F1c942589B63D4f3Ea03) |
| MockUSDT | [`0x41c4986C36Af380d0E5Ba910Bd04947574918ca8`](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/address/0x41c4986C36Af380d0E5Ba910Bd04947574918ca8) |

Task #0 completed a testnet dry run with a scripted verdict: [create transaction](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x7380cbf5494162c17aaa7459f2e770d4e9dcd6424020eb2b18e28df2990d9d45), [verdict transaction](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xf5fe693ddbc5df8767c1c0b44909a8f52d9c1914ce1c2b5e10ab08d627b652a3), [automatic payout](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xd40a90d3570a8b4b363e0202fbb4e163b19a4661d821353a94141c34ff4611f7). The worker received 100 demo mUSDT. This is **not** evidence of a live model call.

Task #1 used `deepseek-flash` in non-thinking mode for both worker and verifier: [create transaction](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xab63f82038aeff8ede9e14b57bf94fb9e302a52c7ec410dcd1bfdf336a04a002), [submission](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xf191c685a7d83d8931a577ffbfbeb3f02653c6e86957863f423b0a3dbdf286ca), [verdict](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x96245213f859c0a2be4923b592335e8ec496ce1b2d8379b96722353f886b8a84), [automatic payout](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x9565c2d4f059c54d3a91201b0de488310c5277dd30a97ffee1b427f5055326a6). The verifier scored it 95/100, its displayed reason matched the on-chain hash, and the worker's balance rose to 200 demo mUSDT across tasks #0 and #1.

**Recommended judging example: task #3.** A more specific factual task was completed by DeepSeek, scored 100/100 with an evidence-based reason, and paid automatically: [create](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xae1b84821d0d93f708bd2bc2197fc06bfe4f474d073c3bd0cc1760cc352d4631), [submit](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x802dfb2fa9c7066948e29f143510ea57f10bf0e613d77af3c02534e923e8e783), [verify](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xac4012e94331fdcc6a8e456aed83ff676d0fa2065a60116a174e321c8aac4c3c), [payout](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x4f0dd71eec45441cd7ab8c25b80542fedd53bacd5d630603394f561f8775b3d2). The displayed reason matched the on-chain hash, and the worker's final balance was 400 demo mUSDT across four test tasks.

## Install and test

```bash
cd contracts
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.4.0 foundry-rs/forge-std@v1.14.0 --no-git
forge test -vv
cd ../services && npm ci && npm run typecheck
cd ../web && npm ci && npm run build
```

If Foundry is installed at `~/.foundry/bin` but not on your `PATH`, prepend that directory to `PATH` for the terminal session.

## Deploy to HSKChain testnet

1. From `services/`, run `npm run wallets` to create four fresh **demo-only** wallets in the root `.env`. It refuses to overwrite an existing file. Or copy `.env.example` and enter your own demo keys and addresses.
2. Fund the printed **deployer**, **agent**, and **verifier** addresses with test HSK. Keep the arbiter wallet accessible for disputes.
3. In `.env`, set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for real DeepSeek calls (`DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-flash`), or `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI. DeepSeek takes priority if both are present. Keep `DEMO_MODE=0` for real calls. To rehearse without a key, set `DEMO_MODE=1` and state clearly that the verdict is scripted. Do not put a key in the repository or browser environment.
4. Run `bash scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` from the repository root. It checks the RPC chain ID, verifier key and deployer balance before broadcasting.
5. Copy the two deployed addresses printed by Foundry into `.env` as `TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `ESCROW_ADDRESS`, and also into `NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ESCROW_ADDRESS`.
6. From `services/`, run `npm run fund-wallets` to send 0.01 test HSK to each agent, verifier and arbiter wallet (it skips wallets already holding at least 0.005 HSK).
7. Start four terminals:

```bash
cd services && npm run server
cd services && npm run agent
cd services && npm run verifier
cd web && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, connect a browser wallet on HSKChain testnet and get test HSK for its gas. The page can mint its own `mUSDT` demo balance. A real WalletConnect project ID is optional for injected wallets; this MVP's RainbowKit list includes browser wallets only.

For a repeatable terminal rehearsal using the deployer wallet, run `cd services && npm run seed`. It mints or reuses 100 demo mUSDT, approves the escrow, and posts a 30-minute task. The agent and verifier processes then pick it up. To change the task wording, set `DEMO_CRITERIA` before running the command.

If a poster disputes a task, the demo arbiter can run `bash scripts/resolve-dispute.sh BOUNTY_ID worker` to pay the worker, or replace `worker` with `poster` to refund the poster. This signs with the locally stored arbiter key.

The deployed Next.js app uses its `/api` route to reach the submission service. Set the web project's `SERVICE_UPSTREAM_URL` to a public HTTPS URL for the running service, and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_URL=/api` at build time. The proxy supplies the ngrok bypass header for the current temporary tunnel. The UI rewrites local submission URLs to `/api/submissions/:id` for viewing; the locally running verifier still fetches the original `localhost` URI from the chain. The API and JSON store must stay online during the demo. This storage is not durable production infrastructure.

## Three-minute presentation

1. “Freelancers can finish work and still wait for a client to approve payment.”
2. Mint demo USDT, create a 100 mUSDT task with concrete acceptance criteria, and show the escrow transaction.
3. Show the agent process accepting and submitting, and the verifier process recording its result. Open the task: score, reason and matching on-chain reason hash are visible.
4. Show the 60-second challenge timer. Explain that the poster can dispute and the arbiter decides in that case.
5. Watch the verifier keeper call `claim`, then show the worker's token balance and the transaction in the explorer.

**Demo fallback:** If the model API is unavailable, use `DEMO_MODE=1`; say “scripted dry run” and do not present the verdict as an AI call. If the keeper is unavailable, use the page's “Release payment” button after 60 seconds.

## Submission checklist

- Add the public GitHub repository and [live demo](https://proofpay-hskchain.vercel.app) to the submission.
- Add both verified HSKChain testnet contract addresses and explorer links to the submission.
- Keep the local API and HTTPS tunnel running so remote reviewers can read submissions and verdicts.
- Include `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as technical documentation.
- Select the **AI x Ethereum & Agent Economy** EAG track and the HSK Chain track if the submission form permits both; ask the organizer what they mean by additional “HSK Chain technology integration.”
- Submit before the local event's **14:00 Sydney time** cutoff. The [organizer's event page](https://luma.com/49iyovqf) lists the 3-minute demo and 2-minute Q&A format.

## Prototype limitations

The verifier and arbiter are trusted keys. The model can make mistakes, and a reason hash proves only that a stored explanation matches the committed bytes, not that the verdict is correct. A submitted task can become stuck if the verifier never responds; this prototype has no timeout arbitration path for `Submitted`. The API has local file storage and no abuse protection. Before handling real funds, add independent security review, a robust dispute process, durable content storage, and a recovery path for unavailable verifiers.
