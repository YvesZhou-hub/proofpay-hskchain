# ProofPay — AI verified bounty escrow

ProofPay locks a demo reward on HSKChain, lets a human or an AI agent deliver work, and lets an AI verifier check the result against written acceptance criteria. A poster has 60 seconds to dispute an approval. After that, the verifier service calls the public `claim` function to release payment; anyone can call it manually if the service is offline.

**This is a hackathon prototype. `mUSDT` is an unrestricted mint demo token with no value. Do not use real funds.**

## What works

- Create a bounty by approving and locking 6-decimal `mUSDT` in `BountyEscrow`.
- Accept and submit as a human via the web app, or let an agent wallet do both.
- Store submission text in the service; keep its URI and Keccak-256 hash on chain.
- AI verifier checks the stored text hash, returns a JSON verdict, and commits the reason hash on chain.
- Show the score and reason in the UI and verify the reason against its on-chain hash.
- Dispute during the challenge window; an arbiter decides where the escrow goes.
- Automatically call `claim` after 60 seconds while the verifier service is running; permissionless manual claim remains available.
- Refund an open or taken bounty after its deadline.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+, npm and [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- Browser wallet (MetaMask or another injected EVM wallet)
- Test HSK for the deployer, agent and verifier wallets from the [official HSKChain faucet guide](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Build-on-HashKey-Chain/Tools/Faucet)
- An OpenAI API key for actual AI execution. `DEMO_MODE=1` runs a scripted dry run and labels its output as such.

HSKChain testnet: chain ID **133**, RPC `https://testnet.hsk.xyz`, live explorer `https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net`. The [official quickstart](https://docs.hskchain.net/docs/Developer-QuickStart) still lists `testnet-explorer.hsk.xyz`, which did not resolve on 26 September 2026; the [Chainlist entry](https://chainid.network/chain/133/) lists the working domain. RPC chain ID and the working explorer were checked live.

Verified HSKChain testnet deployment (26 September 2026):

| Contract | Address |
| --- | --- |
| BountyEscrow | [`0xE0c95F19d607bA0B3100F1c942589B63D4f3Ea03`](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/address/0xE0c95F19d607bA0B3100F1c942589B63D4f3Ea03) |

Task #0 completed a testnet dry run with a scripted verdict: [create transaction](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0x7380cbf5494162c17aaa7459f2e770d4e9dcd6424020eb2b18e28df2990d9d45), [verdict transaction](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xf5fe693ddbc5df8767c1c0b44909a8f52d9c1914ce1c2b5e10ab08d627b652a3), [automatic payout](https://testnet-explorer.hskchain.net/tx/0xd40a90d3570a8b4b363e0202fbb4e163b19a4661d821353a94141c34ff4611f7). The worker received 100 demo mUSDT. This is **not** evidence of a live model call.

## Install and test

```bash
cd contracts
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.4.0 foundry-rs/forge-std@v1.14.0 --no-git
forge test -vv
cd ../services && npm ci && npm run typecheck
cd ../web && npm ci && npm run build
```

If Foundry is installed at `~/.foundry/bin` but not on your `PATH`, prepend that directory to `PATH` for the terminal session.

## Deploy to HSKChain testnet

1. From `services/`, run `npm run wallets` to create four fresh **demo-only** wallets in the root `.env`. It refuses to overwrite an existing file. Or copy `.env.example` and enter your own demo keys and addresses.
2. Fund the printed **deployer**, **agent**, and **verifier** addresses with test HSK. Keep the arbiter wallet accessible for disputes.
3. In `.env`, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for real model calls. To rehearse without an API key, set `DEMO_MODE=1` and state clearly that the verdict is scripted.
4. Run `bash scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` from the repository root. It checks the RPC chain ID, verifier key and deployer balance before broadcasting.
5. Copy the two deployed addresses printed by Foundry into `.env` as `TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `ESCROW_ADDRESS`, and also into `NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ESCROW_ADDRESS`.
6. From `services/`, run `npm run fund-wallets` to send 0.01 test HSK to each agent, verifier and arbiter wallet (it skips wallets already holding at least 0.005 HSK).
7. Start four terminals:

```bash
cd services && npm run server
cd services && npm run agent
cd services && npm run verifier
cd web && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, connect a browser wallet on HSKChain testnet and get test HSK for its gas. The page can mint its own `mUSDT` demo balance. A real WalletConnect project ID is optional for injected wallets; this MVP's RainbowKit list includes browser wallets only.

For a repeatable terminal rehearsal using the deployer wallet, run `cd services && npm run seed`. It mints or reuses 100 demo mUSDT, approves the escrow, and posts a 30-minute task. The agent and verifier processes then pick it up. To change the task wording, set `DEMO_CRITERIA` before running the command.

If a poster disputes a task, the demo arbiter can run `bash scripts/resolve-dispute.sh BOUNTY_ID worker` to pay the worker, or replace `worker` with `poster` to refund the poster. This signs with the locally stored arbiter key.

For a demo on another device, give the submission API a public HTTPS URL and set **both** `SERVICE_BASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_URL` to it *before* creating bounties. On-chain submission URIs made with `localhost` are readable only on the demo machine. The local JSON store is not a production durable storage service.

## Three-minute presentation

1. “Freelancers can finish work and still wait for a client to approve payment.”
2. Mint demo USDT, create a 100 mUSDT task with concrete acceptance criteria, and show the escrow transaction.
3. Show the agent process accepting and submitting, and the verifier process recording its result. Open the task: score, reason and matching on-chain reason hash are visible.
4. Show the 60-second challenge timer. Explain that the poster can dispute and the arbiter decides in that case.
5. Watch the verifier keeper call `claim`, then show the worker's token balance and the transaction in the explorer.

**Demo fallback:** If the model API is unavailable, use `DEMO_MODE=1`; say “scripted dry run” and do not present the verdict as an AI call. If the keeper is unavailable, use the page's “Release payment” button after 60 seconds.

## Submission checklist

- Push this repository to GitHub and add the URL to the submission.
- Deploy contracts to HSKChain testnet and add both contract addresses and explorer links to the submission.
- Provide a running demo URL or a short screen recording; local `localhost` is not accessible to remote reviewers.
- Include `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as technical documentation.
- Select the **AI x Ethereum & Agent Economy** EAG track and the HSK Chain track if the submission form permits both; ask the organizer what they mean by additional “HSK Chain technology integration.”
- Submit before the local event's **14:00 Sydney time** cutoff. The [organizer's event page](https://luma.com/49iyovqf) lists the 3-minute demo and 2-minute Q&A format.

## Prototype limitations

The verifier and arbiter are trusted keys. The model can make mistakes, and a reason hash proves only that a stored explanation matches the committed bytes, not that the verdict is correct. A submitted task can become stuck if the verifier never responds; this prototype has no timeout arbitration path for `Submitted`. The API has local file storage and no abuse protection. Before handling real funds, add independent security review, a robust dispute process, durable content storage, and a recovery path for unavailable verifiers.
